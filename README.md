# üéÆ Linuxgame: Technical Simulation Games

Welcome to the Linuxgame repository! This project is dedicated to creating a series of beginner-friendly technical simulation games designed to make learning cybersecurity, Linux, DevOps, AI, and data analysis concepts interactive and fun.
‚ú® Project Overview

Our goal is to provide a safe, simulated environment where aspiring analysts and enthusiasts can practice and understand complex technical challenges without needing real services or elaborate setups. Each game focuses on different concepts, blending command-line interactions with simulated graphical user interface elements.

    THE PROTOCOL ‚Äì Breach of Node 127.4.7.8:

        A cybersecurity simulation focusing on infiltration, reconnaissance, DevOps, AI anomaly resolution, and data leak analysis.

        Find its specific setup.sh and README.md within the the-protocol/ directory in this repository.

üöÄ Getting Started with a Game

Each game within this repository has its own dedicated directory (e.g., the-protocol/). Inside each game's directory, you will find:

    A specific setup.sh script to install that particular game.

    A README.md file with detailed instructions on how to play that game.

To get started, simply clone this repository and navigate to the game of your choice:

git clone https://github.com/Dev-0618/Linuxgame/
cd Linuxgame/the-protocol/ # Or the directory of another game
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh

(Remember to follow the export PATH instructions provided by each game's setup!)
ü§ù Contributions

We welcome contributions! If you have ideas for new games, improvements, or bug fixes, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Happy Hacking (Simulated)!
